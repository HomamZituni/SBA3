Overview of Project: 

1.) I chose to re-create the fylo data storage component using Bootstrap. This included creating a top card, bottom card, styling icons, adding the background
the appropriate colors, text, fonts, progress bar and data bubble.

2.) Chosen challenge: https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/fylo-data-storage-component-1dZPRbV5n

3.) My approach included creating several divs to re-create the original layout, buttons within those divs, two separate cards,
a progress bar and data bubble. Bootstrap was usede to re-create the colors, styling and to get the appropriate spacing 
to re-create the original dashboard. 

4.) Challenges faced including getting the correct spacing and placement of all the different boxes so the spacing was as 
close to the original as possible. These were addressed by searching through Bootstrap to find out how I could figure out the spacing
and placement.


Reflection: 
Challenges you encountered during the project: I am not comfortable with bootstrap so writing in it is very difficult. The placement of each individual
box or item was a big challenge and understanding how to get it right was not easy. 

Your approach to solving these challenges: The approach was essentially searching through bootstrap documentation to try to understand
how I can get the spacing correct. 

Improvements you would make if given more time: I would probably try to get the placement of the data bubble correct. It is currently not
correct, but I will try to fix it if I get more time down the line.
